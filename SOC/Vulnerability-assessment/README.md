# Vulnerability Assessment Report  
**Targets: Metasploitable 2 & Windows 7 (Isolated Lab Environment)**

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the findings of a comprehensive vulnerability assessment conducted
in a **strictly isolated test environment**. The objective of the assessment was to identify
critical security weaknesses, evaluate their potential impact, and recommend remediation
strategies aligned with SOC best practices.

All activities were performed for **educational and defensive security purposes only**.

---

## Assessment Details

- **Date:** November 14, 2025  
- **Environment:** Isolated virtual lab  
- **Assessment Type:** Unauthenticated network vulnerability assessment  
- **Primary Tool:** Tenable Nessus  

---

## Assets Assessed

| Asset | Description | IP Address |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| Metasploitable 2 | Intentionally vulnerable Linux system | 192.168.98.128 |
| Windows 7 Professional | Legacy Microsoft OS (EOL) | 192.168.98.129 |
| Ubuntu | Scanning and analysis platform | Internal |

---

## Methodology

### 1. Network Discovery
Live hosts were identified within the isolated subnet to confirm reachability prior to scanning.

- ICMP-based discovery was used for Linux targets
- ARP-based discovery was used for Windows targets

This ensured Layer 2/3 connectivity before vulnerability enumeration.

---

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning

- Nessus Essentials was deployed on the Ubuntu scanning host
- The **Basic Network Scan** template was used
- Scans were unauthenticated to reflect a realistic attacker’s initial visibility
- Findings were categorized using CVSS v3 severity ratings

---

## Key Findings Summary

### Overall Risk Rating
**Critical**

Both systems contained vulnerabilities that would allow **remote code execution**, credential
exposure, or complete system compromise if deployed in production environments.

---

## Metasploitable 2 – Key Findings

### Critical Issues Identified
- Backdoored network services
- Weak and default authentication mechanisms
- Deprecated and insecure cryptographic protocols
- Cleartext remote access services

#### Example Risks
- Unauthenticated remote code execution
- Full system compromise
- Credential interception

#### Defensive Insight
These findings highlight how **misconfigured and legacy services dramatically increase attack
surface**, reinforcing the importance of service hardening and continuous vulnerability scanning.

---

## Windows 7 – Key Findings

### Critical Issues Identified
- End-of-Life operating system (no vendor support)
- Unpatched remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Legacy SMB protocol exposure

#### Example Risks
- Wormable exploits
- Lateral movement within internal networks
- Complete host takeover

#### Defensive Insight
Unsupported operating systems represent **unmitigable risk** and should never exist on
production networks.

---

## Recommended Remediation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions
- Decommission unsupported operating systems
- Remove or disable cleartext services (e.g., rlogin, Telnet)
- Disable legacy protocols such as SMBv1

### Phase 2: Strategic Improvements
- Enforce OS lifecycle management policies
- Mandate encrypted administrative protocols (SSH, SFTP)
- Harden firewall rules to limit unnecessary exposure

### Phase 3: SOC Process Integration
- Schedule routine vulnerability scans
- Correlate vulnerability data with SIEM alerts
- Track remediation progress and risk trends over time

---

## SOC Relevance

This assessment reinforces several core SOC principles:
- Vulnerability data must drive proactive defense
- Legacy systems significantly elevate organizational risk
- Detection and prevention are tightly coupled

Understanding how vulnerabilities present at the network level improves both
**incident detection** and **response effectiveness**.
